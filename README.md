## Research Question

> *To what extent do nearest neighbour, dynamic programming, and ant colony optimisation algorithms find the shortest possible route for a school bus?*

---

## Overview

This extended essay applies three combinatorial optimisation algorithms to a real-world school bus routing problem at The Galaxy School, Rajkot, India — a school providing door-to-door transport to 1,500 students and faculty daily.

The bus routing problem is modelled as a variant of the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle through 15 stops, starting and ending at the school. Real GPS coordinates and road distances (sourced from Google Maps) were used throughout.

## Algorithms Compared

### 1. Nearest Neighbour (Heuristic)
Greedy algorithm that always moves to the closest unvisited stop. Simple, fast, and practically intuitive — the same approach bus drivers naturally use.

### 2. Dynamic Programming (Exact)
Exact algorithm using the Held-Karp formulation:

$$g(i, S) = \min_{j \in S} \left[ w(i,j) + g(j, S \setminus \{j\}) \right]$$

Applied to clusters generated by **K-Means** (to manage the exponential time complexity of the full 15-stop problem).

### 3. Ant Colony Optimisation (Heuristic)
Bio-inspired metaheuristic where simulated ants deposit pheromones proportional to path quality:

$$\Delta\tau_{i,j} = \frac{1}{L_{i,j}}$$

Probability of selecting each next stop:

$$P_{i,j} = \frac{(\tau_{i,j})^\alpha \cdot (\eta_{i,j})^\beta}{\sum (\tau_{i,j})^\alpha \cdot (\eta_{i,j})^\beta}$$

## Results

| Method | Route Distance | vs. Original |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Original (Driver) | 8,873 m | — |
| Nearest Neighbour | 8,873 m | No change |
| Dynamic Programming | 9,523 m | +650 m (worse) |
| **Ant Colony Optimisation** | **8,723 m** | **−154 m (best)** |

**Ant colony optimisation** produced the shortest route — 154 meters shorter than the original, translating to approximately **83.2 man-hours saved annually**.

## Methodology

```
Raw stop addresses
       ↓
Google Maps distance matrix (15 × 15)
       ↓
Apply 3 algorithms independently
       ↓
Compare results against original driver route
```

**K-Means clustering** (7 iterations to convergence) was used to partition the 15 stops into 3 geographic clusters before applying dynamic programming, reducing the state space from $O(2^{15} \cdot 15)$ to manageable sub-problems.

## Key Findings

- Nearest neighbour is intuitive and fast, but cannot improve on a route that is already locally optimal
- Dynamic programming guarantees optimality within clusters but lost global optimality when clusters were stitched together — producing a longer route than the original
- Ant colony optimisation, despite being a heuristic, outperformed both other methods by leveraging pheromone-based probabilistic search across the full problem space
- The 154-meter improvement is modest but demonstrates the potential of metaheuristics for real operational problems



## Tools Used

- **Data Collection:** Google Maps (GPS coordinates, road distances)
- **K-Means Computation:** Microsoft Excel
- **Dynamic Programming
- **Typesetting:** LaTeX (`amsmath`, `forest`, `tabularray`, `graphicx`)

## Compiling from Source

```bash
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex   # Run twice for cross-references
```

Requires: `forest`, `tabularray`, `colortbl`, `chemfig`, `wrapfig` packages.

## Limitations and Further Extensions

The essay identifies several limitations — algorithms were tested on only one bus route, dynamic programming was applied to clusters rather than the full problem, and algorithms were not combined with each other. 

Suggested extensions include applying **genetic algorithms** to incorporate traffic levels, **adapted ant colony optimisation** for road quality weighting, and testing all three algorithms across multiple bus routes to determine statistical performance differences.
